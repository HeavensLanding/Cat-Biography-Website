    <h3>Biography of an Orange Popsicle</h3>
    <p>
      Honeybee joined the Rasmussen cat horde October 2022. She came from a
      rescue where they told her story. She was a young kitten when she went
      into her first heat. In this first heat, she immediately got pregnant and
      gave birth. Her litter passed away. She recovered and went into her next
      heat a mere month after her first birth. Again, she got pregnant and again
      her litter all passed away during birth. This extra young mother was
      grieving and depressed. She went into the rescue and thankfully was fixed.
      Even so, she mourned the loss of her littles and it was apparent in her
      demeanor. Courtney went to the rescue with her husband, suffering grief of
      her own. Honeybee was taken to her forever home with the Rasmussens and
      there she resides with her best friend, <a href="Aussie.html">Aussie</a>,
      who helped her endure and recover. Honeybee was scared at first. Even now,
      she is standoffish to people but she has found solace in Courtney and
      Aussie. Now Honeybee is excited about life and thrives on treats. She
      loves to watch TV, especially Peppa Pig.
