    <h3>Biography of a Cute Poot</h3>
    <p>
      Aussie goes by many names, but her most favored nickname is Mrs. Pootini
      or General Poot. She joined the Rasmussen Family in February of 2020. Her
      previous family was unable to give her the life she desired (indoor
      lifestyle) and the husband was allergic so they surrenderd General Poot to
      Courtney and Mitchell. She is part Maine Coone and is gregarious to all.
      Visitors come and you can see her rubbing up against their legs, no matter
      the gender. She greatly enjoys her time in the sun, her preferred location
      being behind the curtains by the back sliding glass door. This allows her
      to soak up the sun. Aussie is loud in her displeasure and even louder in
      her purrs.
