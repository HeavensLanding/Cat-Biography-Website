    <h2>Biography of a Eunuch</h2>
    <p>
      Exactly as the title states, Tino is a eunuch. He came originally to the
      DeWidt family (Courtney's maiden family) Valentine's Day 2017, hence the
      name "Valentino". When he was picked up from the rescue, he waas presumed
      to be a girl and started with the name Valentina. Although his first name
      was switched when the gender was realized, he retained his feminine middle
      names. What happened was, when he was in the rescue, he went to get fixed
      and the veterinarian was new and lopped off everything because the rescue
      owner said that Tino was a girl. How did that vet pass medical school, we
      don't know. Now Tino is living his best life as a eunuch, but what he
      doesn't know (or understand, because, well, he's a cat) can't hurt him.

      Tino is absolute best friends with Courtney. They adore each other and
      support each other emotionally. He is a tortoiseshell with a little white
      spot on the paw Courtney deems as her "favorite" paw. His favorite paw, on
      the other hand (paw?) is his back right. He loves to chew on it and kick
      himself in the face with it. He especially loves cat treats and sleeping
      under the blankets next to Courtney's back.
